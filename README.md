# train-booking-emulator
 Emulator for Booking Trains

 Created in around 3 hours on the suggestion of a friend for another friend who likes booking trains

 I might come back and clean up the UI but I don't have time right now

 I also recognise that it's very rudamentary and that a return ticket wouldn't normally allow you to set a departure station and destination station (they would be auto-filled), but that's a feature to be added later

If you want to add to this project, please do so either by raising issues or forking it and adding to it yourself, I'll try to check the merge requests from time to time
